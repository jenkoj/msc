In contributions chapter \ref{Chapter5}, it was said that the goal will be achieved by answering the three questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we efficiently present big data to humans and machines?
	\item How is this presented data connected in a higher dimensions?
	\item Can we use one of the profiles to build something useful? 
\end{itemize}

By answering the first question we have found new, previously unused ways of presenting the data.
This was achieved by building a detailed table of profiles such as we have seen in chapter \ref{chapter6}.

The second was answered in chapter \ref{Chapter8}, where we have shown how data is connected in high dimension space
using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. 

The last was answered in chapter \ref{Chapter7}, by building functioning elderly care assisted living system. 
The results proved that we successfully used one of the proposed load profiles in a real-world scenario. 

While we have filled in a few gaps in the table of profiles, it is up to scientific commonly to fill in the rest.
