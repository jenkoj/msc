	abstract = {In many countries distributed energy resources (DER) (e.g. photovoltaics, batteries, wind turbines, electric vehicles, electric heat pumps, air-conditioning units and smart domestic appliances) are part of the ‘Green Deal’ to deliver a climate neutral society. Policy roadmaps, despite providing a framework and penetration targets for DER, often lack the network planning strategies needed to transition from passive to active distribution networks. Currently, DER's dynamic performance parameters and location identification techniques are not fully standardised. In fact, it can be very ad hoc. Standardised distributed load modelling and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) for equipment manufacturers, installers and network operators is critical to low and medium voltage network management in order to facilitate better balancing, flexibility and electricity trading across and within the power system for mass DER deployment. The aim of this paper is to fill this load modelling and NILM knowledge gap for DERto inform the ‘Green Deal’ transition and support standardisation. In the paper, existing load modelling techniques and NILM methodologies are critically examined to inform and guide research activity, equipment development and regulator thinking, as well as network operators. Seven key findings that need urgent attention are identified to support a smooth power system reconfiguration.}

  abstract={A third of the final electricity in the EU is consumed by households. The increased usage of multiple electrical devices, electromobility, self-generation and consumption of electricity as well as work-from-home will fundamentally change the residential electricity load profile, so a deep understanding of the current state of residential electricity load profile modelling is necessary. The objective of this paper is to perform a literature review, evaluate the current state of the residential electricity load profile modelling, categorise the models, propose future research directions and applications, identify the challenges the researchers face when building these models and offer possible solutions. Thirty two residential electricity load profile models are identified and a new definition of the residential electricity load profile model is proposed. A new categorisation system based on the identification of the main features of these thirty two studies is introduced. Future research directions and applications are presented and the most important challenges that modellers face when attempting to build such models are identified and discussed. The most important challenge identified is the privacy concerns of the participants or potential participants. These concerns are at least partially responsible for the existence of the rest of the challenges. The creation and implementation of an anonymisation algorithm, before any human has access to any measured datasets, the implementation of a crowd sourcing approach which addresses the privacy concerns of the citizens and increased funding for the installation of privacy-proof smart-meters by the public and measurement campaigns are identified as possible solutions to the challenges faced by modellers.},

We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.}

abstract = {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.}

The model follows a "bottom-up" approach, allowing construction of the relative load shape of the area, starting from knowledge of its most relevant socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, unitary energy consumption and the load profiles of individual household appliances. Several probability functions have been introduced in order to cover the close relationship existing between the demand of residential customers and the psychological and behavioral factors typical of the household; the model makes frequent use of the latter through a Monte Carlo extraction process. The model has been applied for the simulation of a residential area where field measurements of power demand had been made at 15-minute intervals and a combined mail survey had been conducted to investigate household energy usage.

abstract = {Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and smart sensors installed in residential buildings. If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention.

  abstract={Appliance fault in buildings resulting in abnormal energy consumption is known as an anomaly. Traditionally, anomaly detection is performed either at aggregate, i.e., meter-level, or at appliance level. Meter-level anomaly detection does not identify the anomaly-causing appliance, while appliance-level detection requires submetering each appliance in the building. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been proposed as an alternative to submetering to detect when appliances are running as well as estimate the appliance energy consumption. So far, applications have revolved around meaningful energy feedback. In this paper, we assess whether NILM can indeed be used for anomaly detection, as an alternative to submetering. We propose a supervised anomaly detection approach, AEM, and evaluate the effectiveness of NILM for anomaly detection. The proposed approach first learns an appliance's normal operation and then monitors its energy consumption for anomaly detection. We resort to real data, aggregate and subme-tered data from the two-year long REFIT dataset. We explain why anomaly detection performs worse with NILM data as compared to submetered data, highlighting the need for new, anomaly-aware NILM approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The forecasting of the load profile of the domestic sector is an area of increased concern for the power grid as it appears in many applications, such as grid operations, demand side management, energy trading, and so forth. Accordingly, a bottom-up forecasting framework is presented in this paper based upon bottom level data about the electricity consumption of household appliances. In the proposed framework, a load profile for group households is obtained with a similar day extraction module, household behavior analysis module, and household behavior prediction module. Concretely, similar day extraction module is the core of the prediction and is employed to extract similar historical days by considering the external environmental and household internal influence factors on energy consumption. The household behavior analysis module is used to analyse and formulate the consumption behavior probability of appliances according to the statistical characteristics of appliances&rsquo; switch state in historical similar days. Based on the former two modules, household behavior prediction module is responsible for the load profile of group households. Finally, a case study based on the measured data in a practical residential community is performed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bottom-up household load forecasting approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the increment of distributed electricity generation based on renewable energy sources and improvement of communication technologies have caused the development of next-generation power grids known as smart grids. The structures of smart grids have bidirectional communication capability and enable the connection of energy generated from distributed sources to any point on the grid. They also support consumers in energy efficiency by creating opportunities for management of power consumption. The information on power consumption and load profiles of home appliances is essential to perform load management in the dwelling accurately. In this study, the power consumption data for all the basic home appliances, utilized in a two-person family in Çankırı, Turkey, was obtained with high resolution in one-second intervals. The detailed power consumption analysis and load profile were executed for each home appliance. The obtained data is not only the average power consumption of each appliance but also characterizes different operating modes or their cycles. In addition, the impact of these devices on home energy management studies and their standby power consumptions were also discussed. The acquired data is an important source to determine the load profile of individual home appliances precisely in home energy management studies. Although the results of this study do not completely reflect the energy consumption behavior of the people who live in this region, they can reveal the trends in load demands based on a real sample and customer consumption behavior of a typical two-person family.},

abstract = {Identification of faulty appliance behaviour in real time can signal energy wastage and the need for appliance servicing or replacement leading to energy savings. The problem of appliance fault or anomaly detection has been tackled vastly in relation to submetering, which is not scalable since it requires separate meters for each appliance. At the same time, for applications such as energy feedback, Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has been recognised as a scalable and practical alternative to submetering. However, the usability of NILM for anomaly detection has not yet been investigated. Since the goal of NILM is to provide energy consumption estimate, it is unclear if the signal fidelity of appliance signatures generated by state-of-the-art NILM is sufficient to enable accurate appliance fault detection. In this paper, we attempt to determine whether appliance signatures detected by NILM can be used directly for anomaly detection. This is carried out by proposing an anomaly detection algorithm which performs well for submetering data and evaluate its ability to identify the same faulty behaviour of appliances but with NILM-generated appliance power traces. Our results on a dataset of six residential homes using four state-of-the-art NILM algorithms show that, on average, NILM traces are not as robust to identification of faulty behaviour as compared to using submetered data. We discuss in detail observations pertaining to the reconstructed appliance signatures following NILM and their fidelity with respect to noise-free submetered data.}

Yet, it is a challenge to change habitual behavior, embedded in everyday routines. This paper intends to discover whether habitual behavior can be identified by pattern recognition techniques. The data source is an experiment similar to a utility led advanced metering infrastructure implementation. The analysis discovers: (1) persistent daily routines and (2) patterns of consumption or baselines typical of specific weather and daily conditions. Approximately 80 \% of household electricity use can be explained within these two patterns, with several applicable “profiles” for this population, including: unoccupied baseline, hot working days, temperate working days, cold working days, and cold weekend days. The proposed methodology demonstrates that it is possible to use pattern recognition methodologies to recognize habitual electricity consumption behavior given the intrinsic characteristics of the family. This approach could be useful to improve small scale forecast, and as a mechanism to enable the provision of tailor-made information to the families.}

  abstract={In the majority of current supervised nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques the characteristics of the training and test datasets are assumed to be constant. However, in practice, a new appliance may be added to the set of electrical appliances, an appliance may be replaced by a new one, the efficiency of an appliance may change during the time, or a fault may occur. All these issues of appliances cause abnormal consumption in total signal and not detecting them reduces the NILM accuracy. In this sense, submetering is widely used to address the above challenge. However, it leads to additional costs for consumers as it requires additional meters, disturbs consumers’ comfort and privacy, and is not scalable. In this paper, the non-intrusive load monitoring approach is utilized to detect the above anomalies based on two main factors: 1) the power distribution and 2) the participation index of appliances. Since the proposed method is nonintrusive it is cost-efficient and accommodates the consumer’s privacy and comfort. Furthermore, detecting all the above appliance anomalies not only increases the NILM accuracy but also reduces energy waste and avoids appliance breakdown. The experimental results prove that the proposed method yields outstanding performance in detecting the aforementioned anomalies.},

abstract={Many elderly people spend a lot of time in their homes, doing simple or complex activities that often involve the usage of electrical devices. Therefore, detecting how elderly people use household appliances and digital devices is indicative for early detecting the onset of Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) and frailty conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach for monitoring elderly behavior by detecting home appliance's usage. It is based on an unobtrusive infrastructure composed of a smart meter that constantly measures the global power consumption in the house, supported by some smart-plugs for monitoring specific electrical devices. This infrastructure has been implemented and validated within the H2020 City4Age Project.},

The authors developed an energy and environmental extended input–output model, combined with the life cycle assessment, to analyse the role of the building sector in the reduction of Italian energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In detail, the model allows to assess the energy and environmental benefits arising from the Italian tax deduction policy for energy retrofit actions of buildings. Moreover, the authors defined an original model to assess the indirect rebound effect caused by the energy retrofit actions. The outcomes of the research point out that the assessment of the benefits arising from a specific sustainable policy, strongly depends on:-the indirect energy consumed by industry to produce goods and services needed for the policy actuation;-the indirect energy saving, owing to the implemented policy, which in the examined case study has the same order of magnitude as the direct one;-the rebound effect, often neglected in the literature, which can partially avoid the obtained benefits. The model shows wide ranges of applicability to the European context, since it uses as input economic and energy data usually available at local and/or national level for many states in Europe. It may represent a useful tool to decision-makers in the selection of policies oriented to the reduction of energy and environmental impacts caused by final consumption.}

The analysis shows that there is a clear trend to pay more attention to users in new smart grid projects. However, too much focus on technology and economic incentives can become a barrier. Some institutional barriers have been identified. New innovative business models should be developed to explore different options to involve users. The many pilot and demonstration projects that are taking shape or are being planned offer an excellent opportunity for such an exploration. Learning on the social dimensions of smart grids, and the international exchange of experiences can prevent a premature lock-in in a particular pathway.}

abstract = {The home energy management is an efficient tool to manage energy in the buildings that organizes different technologies and mathematical techniques to minimize energy cost. Home energy management often utilizes renewable energy resources to supply load demand in the building. Current home energy management systems utilize one or several of the available hardware-software capacity resources to deal with energy consumption in the buildings. However, a comprehensive model including various hardware and software capacity resources may increase the flexibility of the model. In this regard, this paper studies an efficient paradigm for home energy management in the building connected to electric grid. The proposed model forms an energy hub including the hardware resources (i.e., vehicle-to-home, wind turbine, and diesel generator) and software tools (i.e., demand response program). All the capacity resources and grid power are optimally adjusted to minimize the daily operational cost of the building as well as improvement of resiliency and self-healing. Wind energy and load uncertainty are modeled through stochastic programming. The seasonal pattern is considered for loads, prices, and wind energy. Simulation results demonstrate that operating all capacity resources minimizes the daily operational cost. When the wind energy, demand response program, vehicle-to-home, and diesel generator are not utilized, the cost is increased by 900, 230, 84, and 322, respectively. It is also confirmed that the building not only can operate when one of the components is not connected, but also it is able to supply the demand under off-grid operation.}

The experiment was conducted as part of the Car as Power Plant project at The Green Village in the Netherlands. The main objective was to assess the end-user’s potential of implementing FCEVs in vehicle-to-grid operation (FCEV2G) to act as a local energy source. FCEV2G field test performance with a Hyundai ix35 FCEV are presented. The car was adapted using a power output socket capable of delivering up to 10 kW direct current (DC) to the alternating current (AC) national grid when parked, via an off-board (grid-tie) inverter. A Tank-To-AC-Grid efficiency (analogous to Tank-To-Wheel efficiency when driving) of 44 (measured on a Higher Heating Value basis) was obtained when the car was operating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode at the maximum power output. By collecting and analysing real data on the FCEV power production in V2G mode, and on BIPV production and household consumption, two different operating modes for the FCEV offering balanced services to a residential microgrid were identified, namely fixed power output and load following. Based on the data collected, one-year simulations of a microgrid consisting of 10 all-electric dwellings and 5 cars with the different FCEV2G modes of operation were performed. Simulation results were evaluated on the factors of autonomy, self-consumption of locally produced energy and net-energy consumption by implementing different energy indicators. The results show that utilizing an FCEV working in V2G mode can reduce the annual imported electricity from the grid by approximately 71 over one year, and aiding the buildings in the microgrid to achieve a net zero-energy building target. Furthermore, the simulation results show that utilizing the FCEV2G setup in both modes analysed, could be economically beneficial for the end-user if hydrogen prices at the pump fall below 8.24 €/kg.}

With the growth in small and medium-sized agents using solar photovoltaic panels, smart meters, vehicle-to-grid electric automobiles, home batteries and other `smart' devices, prosuming offers the potential for consumers and vehicle owners to re-evaluate their energy practices. As the number of prosumers increases, the electric utility sector of today is likely to undergo significant changes over the coming decades, offering possibilities for greening of the system, but also bringing many unknowns and risks that need to be identified and managed. To develop strategies for the future, policymakers and planners need knowledge of how prosumers could be integrated effectively and efficiently into competitive electricity markets. Here we identify and discuss three promising potential prosumer markets related to prosumer grid integration, peer-to-peer models and prosumer community groups. We also caution against optimism by laying out a series of caveats and complexities.},

Although smart meters are equipped with encrypted communication and tamper-detection features, they are likely to be exposed to multiple cyber attacks. These meters may be easily compromised to falsify meter readings, which increases the chances and diversifies the types of energy theft. To thwart energy fraud from smart meters, utility providers are identifying anomalous consumption patterns reported to operation centers by leveraging on consumers consumption data collected from advanced metering infrastructure. In this paper, we put forward a new anomaly detection framework to evaluate consumers energy utilization behavior for identifying the localities of potential energy frauds and faulty meters. Metrics known as the loss factor and error term are introduced to estimate the amount of technical losses and capture the measurement noise, respectively in the distribution lines and transformers. The anomaly detection framework is then enhanced to detect consumers malfeasance and faulty meters even when there are intermittent cheating and faulty equipment, improving its robustness. Results from both simulations and test rig show that the proposed framework can successfully locate fraudulent consumers and discover faulty smart meters.}

According to the environmental conditions and real time market price of electricity in Singapore, two real-time price-based scheduling algorithms are proposed and studied in this paper. Simulations were conducted with different percentages of deferrable loads and solar penetration levels, with about 1 million devices participating in the demand side management program. The results show that the proposed algorithms schedule tasks resulting in a significant reduction in electricity bill cost. The algorithm was further modified to include demand and renewable generation forecasts to mitigate the problem of variability, which resulted in deeper possible renewable penetration and better system stability.},

As real time voltage control is known as a legacy system that can be fully activated by DA equipments, in this paper an analytical study is reported to demonstrate the effects of load curtailments on voltages profile in distribution network. A new method for real time voltage control, based on emergency demand response program, is also proposed. The proposed method uses the real-time measured data collected by RTUs and determines the tap changer condition and load curtailment required in order to maintain the distribution voltage profile. Emergency conditions include outages of generators and lines, and fluctuations due to unpredictable load demand and renewable generation. A novel voltage sensitivity matrix, based on performed voltage sensitivity analysis due to load participation in demand response program, is also proposed. In order to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme, it is tested on a typical automated distribution network. Simulation results show that the proper selection of load curtailment can improve voltage profile and that, in emergency conditions, demand response is an effective way to keep the voltage in a permissible range.}

ABSTRACT = {With rapid smart grid technology development, the customer can actively participate in demand-side management (DSM) with the mutual information communication between the distributor operation company and the smart devices in real-time. Controllable load management not only has the advantage of peak shaving, load balance, frequency regulation, and voltage stability, but is also effective at providing fast balancing services to the renewable energy grid in the distributed power system. The load management faces an enormous challenge as the customer has a large number of both small residential loads and dispersed renewable sources. In this paper, various controllable load management approaches are discussed. The traditional controllable load approaches such as the end users’ controllable appliances, storage battery, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), and heat storage are reviewed. The “broad controllable loads” management, such as the microgrid, Virtual Power Plant (VPP), and the load aggregator are also presented. Furthermore, the load characteristics, control strategies, and control effectiveness are analyzed.},

  abstract={In this paper, an optimal power dispatch problem on a 24-h basis for distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DER) also including directly controlled shiftable loads is presented. In the literature, the optimal energy management problems in smart grids (SGs) where such types of loads exist are formulated using integer or mixed integer variables. In this paper, a new formulation of shiftable loads is employed. Such formulation allows reduction in the number of optimization variables and the adoption of real valued optimization methods such as the one proposed in this paper. The method applied is a novel nature-inspired multiobjective optimization algorithm based on an original extension of a glowworm swarm particles optimization algorithm, with algorithmic enhancements to treat multiple objective formulations. The performance of the algorithm is compared to the NSGA-II on the considered power systems application.},

  abstract={This paper describes and evaluates the feasibility of control strategies to be adopted for the operation of a microgrid when it becomes isolated. Normally, the microgrid operates in interconnected mode with the medium voltage network; however, scheduled or forced isolation can take place. In such conditions, the microgrid must have the ability to operate stably and autonomously. An evaluation of the need of storage devices and load shedding strategies is included in this paper.},

abstract = {Approximately 27  of the European energy consumption is caused by the domestic sector, where 19 of the end use energy demand is caused by electric devices. To investigate the factors at play, a stochastic bottom-up model for the generation of electric load profiles is introduced in this paper. The model is designed for investigating the effects of occupant behaviour, appliance stock and efficiency on the electric load profile of an individual household. For each activity of a person in the household, an electric appliance is used, and its electricity consumption is linked to measured electric load traces with a time resolution of 10s. Probability distributions are incorporated for when and how often an appliance is operated. Duration of operation is given as probability density conditional on the start time. Shared use of an appliance by multiple persons is included in the model. Seasonal effects are considered by using changing probability sets during the course of the year. For validation, seven subgroups, which reflect typical household configurations, were formed and tested against measured field data from 430 households in 9 different cities across Germany. The results showed an accuracy of 91  and a correlation of up to 0.98.}
