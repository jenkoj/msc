Policy roadmaps, despite providing a framework and penetration targets for DER, often lack the network planning strategies needed to transition from passive to active distribution networks. Currently, DER's dynamic performance parameters and location identification techniques are not fully standardised. In fact, it can be very ad hoc. Standardised distributed load modelling and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) for equipment manufacturers, installers and network operators is critical to low and medium voltage network management in order to facilitate better balancing, flexibility and electricity trading across and within the power system for mass DER deployment. The aim of this paper is to fill this load modelling and NILM knowledge gap for DERto inform the ‘Green Deal’ transition and support standardisation. In the paper, existing load modelling techniques and NILM methodologies are critically examined to inform and guide research activity, equipment development and regulator thinking, as well as network operators. Seven key findings that need urgent attention are identified to support a smooth power system reconfiguration.}

  abstract={A third of the final electricity in the EU is consumed by households. The increased usage of multiple electrical devices, electromobility, self-generation and consumption of electricity as well as work-from-home will fundamentally change the residential electricity load profile, so a deep understanding of the current state of residential electricity load profile modelling is necessary. The objective of this paper is to perform a literature review, evaluate the current state of the residential electricity load profile modelling, categorise the models, propose future research directions and applications, identify the challenges the researchers face when building these models and offer possible solutions. Thirty two residential electricity load profile models are identified and a new definition of the residential electricity load profile model is proposed. A new categorisation system based on the identification of the main features of these thirty two studies is introduced. Future research directions and applications are presented and the most important challenges that modellers face when attempting to build such models are identified and discussed. The most important challenge identified is the privacy concerns of the participants or potential participants. These concerns are at least partially responsible for the existence of the rest of the challenges. The creation and implementation of an anonymisation algorithm, before any human has access to any measured datasets, the implementation of a crowd sourcing approach which addresses the privacy concerns of the citizens and increased funding for the installation of privacy-proof smart-meters by the public and measurement campaigns are identified as possible solutions to the challenges faced by modellers.},

We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.}

The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.}

The model follows a "bottom-up" approach, allowing construction of the relative load shape of the area, starting from knowledge of its most relevant socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, unitary energy consumption and the load profiles of individual household appliances. Several probability functions have been introduced in order to cover the close relationship existing between the demand of residential customers and the psychological and behavioral factors typical of the household; the model makes frequent use of the latter through a Monte Carlo extraction process. The model has been applied for the simulation of a residential area where field measurements of power demand had been made at 15-minute intervals and a combined mail survey had been conducted to investigate household energy usage.

abstract = {Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and smart sensors installed in residential buildings. If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention.

  abstract={Appliance fault in buildings resulting in abnormal energy consumption is known as an anomaly. Traditionally, anomaly detection is performed either at aggregate, i.e., meter-level, or at appliance level. Meter-level anomaly detection does not identify the anomaly-causing appliance, while appliance-level detection requires submetering each appliance in the building. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been proposed as an alternative to submetering to detect when appliances are running as well as estimate the appliance energy consumption. So far, applications have revolved around meaningful energy feedback. In this paper, we assess whether NILM can indeed be used for anomaly detection, as an alternative to submetering. We propose a supervised anomaly detection approach, AEM, and evaluate the effectiveness of NILM for anomaly detection. The proposed approach first learns an appliance's normal operation and then monitors its energy consumption for anomaly detection. We resort to real data, aggregate and subme-tered data from the two-year long REFIT dataset. We explain why anomaly detection performs worse with NILM data as compared to submetered data, highlighting the need for new, anomaly-aware NILM approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The forecasting of the load profile of the domestic sector is an area of increased concern for the power grid as it appears in many applications, such as grid operations, demand side management, energy trading, and so forth. Accordingly, a bottom-up forecasting framework is presented in this paper based upon bottom level data about the electricity consumption of household appliances. In the proposed framework, a load profile for group households is obtained with a similar day extraction module, household behavior analysis module, and household behavior prediction module. Concretely, similar day extraction module is the core of the prediction and is employed to extract similar historical days by considering the external environmental and household internal influence factors on energy consumption. The household behavior analysis module is used to analyse and formulate the consumption behavior probability of appliances according to the statistical characteristics of appliances&rsquo; switch state in historical similar days. Based on the former two modules, household behavior prediction module is responsible for the load profile of group households. Finally, a case study based on the measured data in a practical residential community is performed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bottom-up household load forecasting approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the increment of distributed electricity generation based on renewable energy sources and improvement of communication technologies have caused the development of next-generation power grids known as smart grids. The structures of smart grids have bidirectional communication capability and enable the connection of energy generated from distributed sources to any point on the grid. They also support consumers in energy efficiency by creating opportunities for management of power consumption. The information on power consumption and load profiles of home appliances is essential to perform load management in the dwelling accurately. In this study, the power consumption data for all the basic home appliances, utilized in a two-person family in Çankırı, Turkey, was obtained with high resolution in one-second intervals. The detailed power consumption analysis and load profile were executed for each home appliance. The obtained data is not only the average power consumption of each appliance but also characterizes different operating modes or their cycles. In addition, the impact of these devices on home energy management studies and their standby power consumptions were also discussed. The acquired data is an important source to determine the load profile of individual home appliances precisely in home energy management studies. Although the results of this study do not completely reflect the energy consumption behavior of the people who live in this region, they can reveal the trends in load demands based on a real sample and customer consumption behavior of a typical two-person family.},

abstract = {Identification of faulty appliance behaviour in real time can signal energy wastage and the need for appliance servicing or replacement leading to energy savings. The problem of appliance fault or anomaly detection has been tackled vastly in relation to submetering, which is not scalable since it requires separate meters for each appliance. At the same time, for applications such as energy feedback, Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has been recognised as a scalable and practical alternative to submetering. However, the usability of NILM for anomaly detection has not yet been investigated. Since the goal of NILM is to provide energy consumption estimate, it is unclear if the signal fidelity of appliance signatures generated by state-of-the-art NILM is sufficient to enable accurate appliance fault detection. In this paper, we attempt to determine whether appliance signatures detected by NILM can be used directly for anomaly detection. This is carried out by proposing an anomaly detection algorithm which performs well for submetering data and evaluate its ability to identify the same faulty behaviour of appliances but with NILM-generated appliance power traces. Our results on a dataset of six residential homes using four state-of-the-art NILM algorithms show that, on average, NILM traces are not as robust to identification of faulty behaviour as compared to using submetered data. We discuss in detail observations pertaining to the reconstructed appliance signatures following NILM and their fidelity with respect to noise-free submetered data.}

Yet, it is a challenge to change habitual behavior, embedded in everyday routines. This paper intends to discover whether habitual behavior can be identified by pattern recognition techniques. The data source is an experiment similar to a utility led advanced metering infrastructure implementation. The analysis discovers: (1) persistent daily routines and (2) patterns of consumption or baselines typical of specific weather and daily conditions. Approximately 80 \% of household electricity use can be explained within these two patterns, with several applicable “profiles” for this population, including: unoccupied baseline, hot working days, temperate working days, cold working days, and cold weekend days. The proposed methodology demonstrates that it is possible to use pattern recognition methodologies to recognize habitual electricity consumption behavior given the intrinsic characteristics of the family. This approach could be useful to improve small scale forecast, and as a mechanism to enable the provision of tailor-made information to the families.}

  abstract={In the majority of current supervised nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques the characteristics of the training and test datasets are assumed to be constant. However, in practice, a new appliance may be added to the set of electrical appliances, an appliance may be replaced by a new one, the efficiency of an appliance may change during the time, or a fault may occur. All these issues of appliances cause abnormal consumption in total signal and not detecting them reduces the NILM accuracy. In this sense, submetering is widely used to address the above challenge. However, it leads to additional costs for consumers as it requires additional meters, disturbs consumers’ comfort and privacy, and is not scalable. In this paper, the non-intrusive load monitoring approach is utilized to detect the above anomalies based on two main factors: 1) the power distribution and 2) the participation index of appliances. Since the proposed method is nonintrusive it is cost-efficient and accommodates the consumer’s privacy and comfort. Furthermore, detecting all the above appliance anomalies not only increases the NILM accuracy but also reduces energy waste and avoids appliance breakdown. The experimental results prove that the proposed method yields outstanding performance in detecting the aforementioned anomalies.},
