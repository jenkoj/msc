    Recognizing habitual behavior and providing feedback in context are key to
  empower individuals to take control over residential electricity consumption.
  Yet, it is a challenge to change habitual behavior, embedded in everyday
  routines. This paper intends to discover whether habitual behavior can be
  identified by pattern recognition techniques. The data source is an
  experiment similar to a utility led advanced metering infrastructure
  implementation. The analysis discovers: (1) persistent daily routines and (2)
  patterns of consumption or baselines typical of specific weather and daily
  conditions. Approximately 80 \% of household electricity use can be explained
  within these two patterns, with several applicable “profiles” for this
  population, including: unoccupied baseline, hot working days, temperate
  working days, cold working days, and cold weekend days. The proposed
  methodology demonstrates that it is possible to use pattern recognition
  methodologies to recognize habitual electricity consumption behavior given
  the intrinsic characteristics of the family. This approach could be useful to
  improve small scale forecast, and as a mechanism to enable the provision of
  tailor-made information to the families.%

    In the majority of current supervised nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM)
  techniques the characteristics of the training and test datasets are assumed
  to be constant. However, in practice, a new appliance may be added to the set
  of electrical appliances, an appliance may be replaced by a new one, the
  efficiency of an appliance may change during the time, or a fault may occur.
  All these issues of appliances cause abnormal consumption in total signal and
  not detecting them reduces the NILM accuracy. In this sense, submetering is
  widely used to address the above challenge. However, it leads to additional
  costs for consumers as it requires additional meters, disturbs consumers’
  comfort and privacy, and is not scalable. In this paper, the non-intrusive
  load monitoring approach is utilized to detect the above anomalies based on
  two main factors: 1) the power distribution and 2) the participation index of
  appliances. Since the proposed method is nonintrusive it is cost-efficient
  and accommodates the consumer’s privacy and comfort. Furthermore, detecting
  all the above appliance anomalies not only increases the NILM accuracy but
  also reduces energy waste and avoids appliance breakdown. The experimental
  results prove that the proposed method yields outstanding performance in
  detecting the aforementioned anomalies.%

    A model of electric residential end-use is proposed for establishing the
  load diagram of an area by a process of synthesis. The model follows a
  "bottom-up" approach, allowing construction of the relative load shape of the
  area, starting from knowledge of its most relevant socioeconomic and
  demographic characteristics, unitary energy consumption and the load profiles
  of individual household appliances. Several probability functions have been
  introduced in order to cover the close relationship existing between the
  demand of residential customers and the psychological and behavioral factors
  typical of the household; the model makes frequent use of the latter through
  a Monte Carlo extraction process. The model has been applied for the
  simulation of a residential area where field measurements of power demand had
  been made at 15-minute intervals and a combined mail survey had been
  conducted to investigate household energy usage. The paper reports the
  results of a comparison between recorded and predicted load
  profiles.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>%

    The paper presents one of the first Italian experiences assessing the
  effectiveness of sustainable production and consumption strategies. The
  authors developed an energy and environmental extended input–output model,
  combined with the life cycle assessment, to analyse the role of the building
  sector in the reduction of Italian energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In
  detail, the model allows to assess the energy and environmental benefits
  arising from the Italian tax deduction policy for energy retrofit actions of
  buildings. Moreover, the authors defined an original model to assess the
  indirect rebound effect caused by the energy retrofit actions. The outcomes
  of the research point out that the assessment of the benefits arising from a
  specific sustainable policy, strongly depends on:-the indirect energy
  consumed by industry to produce goods and services needed for the policy
  actuation;-the indirect energy saving, owing to the implemented policy, which
  in the examined case study has the same order of magnitude as the direct
  one;-the rebound effect, often neglected in the literature, which can
  partially avoid the obtained benefits. The model shows wide ranges of
  applicability to the European context, since it uses as input economic and
  energy data usually available at local and/or national level for many states
  in Europe. It may represent a useful tool to decision-makers in the selection
  of policies oriented to the reduction of energy and environmental impacts
  caused by final consumption.%

    Future electricity grids will enable greater and more sophisticated
  demand-side participation, which refers to the inclusion of mechanisms that
  enable dynamic modification of electricity demand into the operations of
  power grids, known as demand response (DR). The underlying information-flow
  infrastructures provided by the emerging smart grid enhance the interactions
  between customers and the market, by which DR will improve electricity grids
  in several aspects, for example, by reducing peak demand and reducing need
  for expensive peaker plants, or by enabling demand to follow supply such as
  those from volatile renewable resources. In this chapter, various DR programs
  and implementations provided by utilities and Independent System
  Operators/Regional Transmission Organizations in the United States will be
  described. A distributed direct load control approach for large-scale
  residential DR will be discussed as a case study, with numerical results to
  demonstrate its effectiveness.%

    The paper has a focus on energy consumption habits, trends and intervention
  strategies in residential buildings, mainly through the serious game approach
  with a combination of direct consumer feedback through smart metering. More
  than 150 homes in France and Spain have been involved in the research
  experiment and the consumption habits of approximately 50 homes were deeply
  analyzed. The applied methods, processes, results and findings of the
  monitoring data analysis are presented in the paper with two aims. First,
  consumption profiles and trends were determined for apartment homes with
  regard to heating, domestic hot water and electric consumption. Second, the
  impact of a serious game experiment was assessed comparing energy
  consumption, indoor air temperature and users’ habits (based on
  questionnaires) before and after launching the experiment.%

    Approximately 27 of the European energy consumption is caused by the
  domestic sector, where 19 of the end use energy demand is caused by electric
  devices. To investigate the factors at play, a stochastic bottom-up model for
  the generation of electric load profiles is introduced in this paper. The
  model is designed for investigating the effects of occupant behaviour,
  appliance stock and efficiency on the electric load profile of an individual
  household. For each activity of a person in the household, an electric
  appliance is used, and its electricity consumption is linked to measured
  electric load traces with a time resolution of 10s. Probability distributions
  are incorporated for when and how often an appliance is operated. Duration of
  operation is given as probability density conditional on the start time.
  Shared use of an appliance by multiple persons is included in the model.
  Seasonal effects are considered by using changing probability sets during the
  course of the year. For validation, seven subgroups, which reflect typical
  household configurations, were formed and tested against measured field data
  from 430 households in 9 different cities across Germany. The results showed
  an accuracy of 91 and a correlation of up to 0.98.%

    The forecasting of the load profile of the domestic sector is an area of
  increased concern for the power grid as it appears in many applications, such
  as grid operations, demand side management, energy trading, and so forth.
  Accordingly, a bottom-up forecasting framework is presented in this paper
  based upon bottom level data about the electricity consumption of household
  appliances. In the proposed framework, a load profile for group households is
  obtained with a similar day extraction module, household behavior analysis
  module, and household behavior prediction module. Concretely, similar day
  extraction module is the core of the prediction and is employed to extract
  similar historical days by considering the external environmental and
  household internal influence factors on energy consumption. The household
  behavior analysis module is used to analyse and formulate the consumption
  behavior probability of appliances according to the statistical
  characteristics of appliances&rsquo; switch state in historical similar days.
  Based on the former two modules, household behavior prediction module is
  responsible for the load profile of group households. Finally, a case study
  based on the measured data in a practical residential community is performed
  to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bottom-up
  household load forecasting approach.%

    The new emerged operating conditions in the power sector are forcing the
  power-market participants to develop new tools. Among them, load profiles are
  a key issue in retail power markets. For various types of small consumers
  without quarter-hourly load measurements, determination of typical load
  profiles (TLPs) could serve as a tool for determining of their load diagrams.
  Their main function is in billing of consumers who have deviated from their
  contracted schedules. Moreover, a simple and straightforward method for
  assigning a TLP to a particular eligible consumer also needs to be
  established. In this paper, a methodology for allocating consumers' load
  profiles using probabilistic neural network (PNN) is presented. It is based
  on the preprocessed measured load profiles (MLPs), using wavelet
  multiresolution analysis, clustered with a FCM clustering algorithm with an
  appropriate cluster-validity measure. The results demonstrate the efficiency
  of the formation procedure for the proposed TLPs.%

    In this paper, an optimal power dispatch problem on a 24-h basis for
  distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DER) also including
  directly controlled shiftable loads is presented. In the literature, the
  optimal energy management problems in smart grids (SGs) where such types of
  loads exist are formulated using integer or mixed integer variables. In this
  paper, a new formulation of shiftable loads is employed. Such formulation
  allows reduction in the number of optimization variables and the adoption of
  real valued optimization methods such as the one proposed in this paper. The
  method applied is a novel nature-inspired multiobjective optimization
  algorithm based on an original extension of a glowworm swarm particles
  optimization algorithm, with algorithmic enhancements to treat multiple
  objective formulations. The performance of the algorithm is compared to the
  NSGA-II on the considered power systems application.%

    Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and
  smart sensors installed in residential buildings. If leveraged properly, that
  data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in
  detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each
  anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming
  overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce
  wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this
  regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection
  frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence.
  Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive
  taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different
  modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature
  extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and
  application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the
  first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy
  consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific
  problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly
  discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous
  power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess
  the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and
  (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends
  are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly
  detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant
  attention. This article serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the
  current technological progress in anomaly detection of energy consumption
  based on artificial intelligence.%

    Historically, demand response provided value through peak demand reductions
  during a limited number of hours per year. However, system needs are
  evolving—renewables integration, electrification, and grid modernization
  present new opportunities and challenges to the industry. To address these
  challenges, load can be managed to provide additional high-value services,
  such as geographically targeted demand reductions, load building during times
  of renewables curtailment, and real-time system balancing. This “load
  flexibility” has enormous potential, equating to 200GW of peak reduction
  capability and more than $15 billion of annual avoided costs according to the
  authors’ analysis. This chapter summarizes a new methodology for
  quantifying load flexibility potential and presents an outlook for how load
  flexibility may evolve in the coming decade.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In recent years, the increment of distributed electricity generation based
  on renewable energy sources and improvement of communication technologies
  have caused the development of next-generation power grids known as smart
  grids. The structures of smart grids have bidirectional communication
  capability and enable the connection of energy generated from distributed
  sources to any point on the grid. They also support consumers in energy
  efficiency by creating opportunities for management of power consumption. The
  information on power consumption and load profiles of home appliances is
  essential to perform load management in the dwelling accurately. In this
  study, the power consumption data for all the basic home appliances, utilized
  in a two-person family in Çankırı, Turkey, was obtained with high
  resolution in one-second intervals. The detailed power consumption analysis
  and load profile were executed for each home appliance. The obtained data is
  not only the average power consumption of each appliance but also
  characterizes different operating modes or their cycles. In addition, the
  impact of these devices on home energy management studies and their standby
  power consumptions were also discussed. The acquired data is an important
  source to determine the load profile of individual home appliances precisely
  in home energy management studies. Although the results of this study do not
  completely reflect the energy consumption behavior of the people who live in
  this region, they can reveal the trends in load demands based on a real
  sample and customer consumption behavior of a typical two-person family.%

    In this paper, a systematic method is proposed to cluster the energy
  consumption patterns of residential customers by utilizing extreme points and
  demographic characteristics. The extreme points of the energy consumption
  pattern enable effective clustering of residential customers. Additionally,
  demographic characteristics can be used to determine an effective extreme
  point for the clustering algorithm. The K-means-based features selection
  method is used to classify energy consumption patterns of residential
  customers into six types. Furthermore, the type of energy consumption pattern
  can be identified depending on the characteristics of residential customers.
  The analytical results of this paper show that the extreme points are

    We propose a method to examine structural and behavioral determinants of
  residential electricity consumption, by developing separate models for daily
  maximum (peak) and minimum (idle) consumption. We apply our method on a data
  set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that
  weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of
  residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number
  of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most
  important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of
  occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are
  the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing
  double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption,
  as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate
  change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower
  electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19
  and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners
  showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no
  significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level,
  home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features
  such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation
  were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.%

    Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a
  home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests
  that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided
  with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy
  disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating
  appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To
  conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data
  describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the `ground
  truth' demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE:
  an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level
  Electricity at a sample rate of 16{\thinspace}kHz for the whole-house and at
  1/6{\thinspace}Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK
  dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of
  which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any
  energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost,
  open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.%

    Time-shiftable loads, also known as deferrable loads, such as charging of
  electric vehicles, washing machines, dryers, are able to provide scheduling
  flexibility for demand response. This can help to reduce the energy cost
  under the condition of dynamic electricity pricing. It can also facilitate
  deeper integration of renewable generation by absorbing variability.
  According to the environmental conditions and real time market price of
  electricity in Singapore, two real-time price-based scheduling algorithms are
  proposed and studied in this paper. Simulations were conducted with different
  percentages of deferrable loads and solar penetration levels, with about 1
  million devices participating in the demand side management program. The
  results show that the proposed algorithms schedule tasks resulting in a
  significant reduction in electricity bill cost. The algorithm was further
  modified to include demand and renewable generation forecasts to mitigate the
  problem of variability, which resulted in deeper possible renewable
  penetration and better system stability.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The home energy management is an efficient tool to manage energy in the
  buildings that organizes different technologies and mathematical techniques
  to minimize energy cost. Home energy management often utilizes renewable
  energy resources to supply load demand in the building. Current home energy
  management systems utilize one or several of the available hardware-software
  capacity resources to deal with energy consumption in the buildings. However,
  a comprehensive model including various hardware and software capacity
  resources may increase the flexibility of the model. In this regard, this
  paper studies an efficient paradigm for home energy management in the
  building connected to electric grid. The proposed model forms an energy hub
  including the hardware resources (i.e., vehicle-to-home, wind turbine, and
  diesel generator) and software tools (i.e., demand response program). All the
  capacity resources and grid power are optimally adjusted to minimize the
  daily operational cost of the building as well as improvement of resiliency
  and self-healing. Wind energy and load uncertainty are modeled through
  stochastic programming. The seasonal pattern is considered for loads, prices,
  and wind energy. Simulation results demonstrate that operating all capacity
  resources minimizes the daily operational cost. When the wind energy, demand
  response program, vehicle-to-home, and diesel generator are not utilized, the
  cost is increased by 900, 230, 84, and 322, respectively. It is also
  confirmed that the building not only can operate when one of the components
  is not connected, but also it is able to supply the demand under off-grid
  operation.%

    In many countries distributed energy resources (DER) (e.g. photovoltaics,
  batteries, wind turbines, electric vehicles, electric heat pumps,
  air-conditioning units and smart domestic appliances) are part of the
  ‘Green Deal’ to deliver a climate neutral society. Policy roadmaps,
  despite providing a framework and penetration targets for DER, often lack the
  network planning strategies needed to transition from passive to active
  distribution networks. Currently, DER's dynamic performance parameters and
  location identification techniques are not fully standardised. In fact, it
  can be very ad hoc. Standardised distributed load modelling and non-intrusive
  load monitoring (NILM) for equipment manufacturers, installers and network
  operators is critical to low and medium voltage network management in order
  to facilitate better balancing, flexibility and electricity trading across
  and within the power system for mass DER deployment. The aim of this paper is
  to fill this load modelling and NILM knowledge gap for DERto inform the
  ‘Green Deal’ transition and support standardisation. In the paper,
  existing load modelling techniques and NILM methodologies are critically
  examined to inform and guide research activity, equipment development and
  regulator thinking, as well as network operators. Seven key findings that
  need urgent attention are identified to support a smooth power system
  reconfiguration.%

    Increasing complexity of power grids, growing demand, and requirement for
  greater reliability, security and efficiency as well as environmental and
  energy sustainability concerns continue to highlight the need for a quantum
  leap in harnessing communication and information technologies. This leap
  toward a ¿smarter¿ grid is widely referred to as ¿smart grid.¿ A
  framework for cohesive integration of these technologies facilitates
  convergence of acutely needed standards, and implementation of necessary
  analytical capabilities. This paper critically reviews the reliability
  impacts of major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response,
  and storage. We observe that an ideal mix of these resources leads to a
  flatter net demand that eventually accentuates reliability challenges
  further. A gridwide IT architectural framework is presented to meet these
  challenges while facilitating modern cybersecurity measures. This
  architecture supports a multitude of geographically and temporally
  coordinated hierarchical monitoring and control actions over time scales from
  milliseconds and up.%

    Prosumers are agents that both consume and produce energy. With the growth
  in small and medium-sized agents using solar photovoltaic panels, smart
  meters, vehicle-to-grid electric automobiles, home batteries and other
  `smart' devices, prosuming offers the potential for consumers and vehicle
  owners to re-evaluate their energy practices. As the number of prosumers
  increases, the electric utility sector of today is likely to undergo
  significant changes over the coming decades, offering possibilities for
  greening of the system, but also bringing many unknowns and risks that need
  to be identified and managed. To develop strategies for the future,
  policymakers and planners need knowledge of how prosumers could be integrated
  effectively and efficiently into competitive electricity markets. Here we
  identify and discuss three promising potential prosumer markets related to
  prosumer grid integration, peer-to-peer models and prosumer community groups.
  We also caution against optimism by laying out a series of caveats and

    An in-depth understanding of consumer energy consumption patterns is
  essential for accurate forecasting and efficient management. In this paper, a
  novel load profile analysis methodology is proposed using an image processing
  technology that simplifies the understanding and improvement of electricity

  represented as load image profiles in two dimensions. These profiles are
  modified by image processing using filtering and thresholding techniques to
  suppress excessive sensitivity. Subsequently, the clustering algorithms are
  performed to classify the load image profiles, and representative class load
  image profiles are obtained. The resulting clusters are compared to the
  results of conventional load profile analysis. The proposed methodology shows
  enhanced performance over the conventional approach from the viewpoint of

    A third of the final electricity in the EU is consumed by households. The
  increased usage of multiple electrical devices, electromobility,
  self-generation and consumption of electricity as well as work-from-home will
  fundamentally change the residential electricity load profile, so a deep
  understanding of the current state of residential electricity load profile
  modelling is necessary. The objective of this paper is to perform a
  literature review, evaluate the current state of the residential electricity
  load profile modelling, categorise the models, propose future research
  directions and applications, identify the challenges the researchers face
  when building these models and offer possible solutions. Thirty two
  residential electricity load profile models are identified and a new
  definition of the residential electricity load profile model is proposed. A
  new categorisation system based on the identification of the main features of
  these thirty two studies is introduced. Future research directions and
  applications are presented and the most important challenges that modellers
  face when attempting to build such models are identified and discussed. The
  most important challenge identified is the privacy concerns of the
  participants or potential participants. These concerns are at least partially
  responsible for the existence of the rest of the challenges. The creation and
  implementation of an anonymisation algorithm, before any human has access to
  any measured datasets, the implementation of a crowd sourcing approach which
  addresses the privacy concerns of the citizens and increased funding for the
  installation of privacy-proof smart-meters by the public and measurement
  campaigns are identified as possible solutions to the challenges faced by
  modellers.%

    Identification of faulty appliance behaviour in real time can signal energy
  wastage and the need for appliance servicing or replacement leading to energy
  savings. The problem of appliance fault or anomaly detection has been tackled
  vastly in relation to submetering, which is not scalable since it requires
  separate meters for each appliance. At the same time, for applications such
  as energy feedback, Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has been recognised
  as a scalable and practical alternative to submetering. However, the
  usability of NILM for anomaly detection has not yet been investigated. Since
  the goal of NILM is to provide energy consumption estimate, it is unclear if
  the signal fidelity of appliance signatures generated by state-of-the-art
  NILM is sufficient to enable accurate appliance fault detection. In this
  paper, we attempt to determine whether appliance signatures detected by NILM
  can be used directly for anomaly detection. This is carried out by proposing
  an anomaly detection algorithm which performs well for submetering data and
  evaluate its ability to identify the same faulty behaviour of appliances but
  with NILM-generated appliance power traces. Our results on a dataset of six
  residential homes using four state-of-the-art NILM algorithms show that, on
  average, NILM traces are not as robust to identification of faulty behaviour
  as compared to using submetered data. We discuss in detail observations
  pertaining to the reconstructed appliance signatures following NILM and their
  fidelity with respect to noise-free submetered data.%

    Appliance fault in buildings resulting in abnormal energy consumption is
  known as an anomaly. Traditionally, anomaly detection is performed either at
  aggregate, i.e., meter-level, or at appliance level. Meter-level anomaly
  detection does not identify the anomaly-causing appliance, while
  appliance-level detection requires submetering each appliance in the
  building. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been proposed as an
  alternative to submetering to detect when appliances are running as well as
  estimate the appliance energy consumption. So far, applications have revolved
  around meaningful energy feedback. In this paper, we assess whether NILM can
  indeed be used for anomaly detection, as an alternative to submetering. We
  propose a supervised anomaly detection approach, AEM, and evaluate the
  effectiveness of NILM for anomaly detection. The proposed approach first
  learns an appliance's normal operation and then monitors its energy
  consumption for anomaly detection. We resort to real data, aggregate and
  subme-tered data from the two-year long REFIT dataset. We explain why anomaly
  detection performs worse with NILM data as compared to submetered data,
  highlighting the need for new, anomaly-aware NILM approaches.%

    This paper presents the results of a demonstration project, including
  building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar panels, a residential building
  and a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) for combined mobility and
  power generation, aiming to achieve a net zero-energy residential building
  target. The experiment was conducted as part of the Car as Power Plant
  project at The Green Village in the Netherlands. The main objective was to
  assess the end-user’s potential of implementing FCEVs in vehicle-to-grid
  operation (FCEV2G) to act as a local energy source. FCEV2G field test
  performance with a Hyundai ix35 FCEV are presented. The car was adapted using
  a power output socket capable of delivering up to 10 kW direct current (DC)
  to the alternating current (AC) national grid when parked, via an off-board
  (grid-tie) inverter. A Tank-To-AC-Grid efficiency (analogous to Tank-To-Wheel
  efficiency when driving) of 44 (measured on a Higher Heating Value basis) was
  obtained when the car was operating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode at the
  maximum power output. By collecting and analysing real data on the FCEV power
  production in V2G mode, and on BIPV production and household consumption, two
  different operating modes for the FCEV offering balanced services to a
  residential microgrid were identified, namely fixed power output and load
  following. Based on the data collected, one-year simulations of a microgrid
  consisting of 10 all-electric dwellings and 5 cars with the different FCEV2G
  modes of operation were performed. Simulation results were evaluated on the
  factors of autonomy, self-consumption of locally produced energy and
  net-energy consumption by implementing different energy indicators. The
  results show that utilizing an FCEV working in V2G mode can reduce the annual
  imported electricity from the grid by approximately 71 over one year, and
  aiding the buildings in the microgrid to achieve a net zero-energy building
  target. Furthermore, the simulation results show that utilizing the FCEV2G
  setup in both modes analysed, could be economically beneficial for the
  end-user if hydrogen prices at the pump fall below 8.24 €/kg.%

    With rapid smart grid technology development, the customer can actively
  participate in demand-side management (DSM) with the mutual information
  communication between the distributor operation company and the smart devices
  in real-time. Controllable load management not only has the advantage of peak
  shaving, load balance, frequency regulation, and voltage stability, but is
  also effective at providing fast balancing services to the renewable energy
  grid in the distributed power system. The load management faces an enormous
  challenge as the customer has a large number of both small residential loads
  and dispersed renewable sources. In this paper, various controllable load
  management approaches are discussed. The traditional controllable load
  approaches such as the end users’ controllable appliances, storage battery,
  Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), and heat storage are reviewed. The “broad
  controllable loads” management, such as the microgrid, Virtual Power Plant
  (VPP), and the load aggregator are also presented. Furthermore, the load
  characteristics, control strategies, and control effectiveness are analyzed.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the
  associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The
  residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and
  therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy
  consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and
  inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic
  impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies
  suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an
  up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling
  residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are
  identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the
  residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual
  end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the
  energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables
  such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment,
  and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach
  extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of
  individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two
  distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method.
  Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different
  calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different
  applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the
  strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of
  models reported in the literature.%

  the basis of customers' observed loads. The resulting end-use loads, called
  statistically adjusted engineering (SAE) loads, depend on a variety of

    This article analyses practices and perceptions of stakeholders on

  interviews have been conducted and smart grid projects have been analysed,
  using a Strategic Niche Management framework. The analysis shows that there
  is a clear trend to pay more attention to users in new smart grid projects.
  However, too much focus on technology and economic incentives can become a
  barrier. Some institutional barriers have been identified. New innovative
  business models should be developed to explore different options to involve
  users. The many pilot and demonstration projects that are taking shape or are
  being planned offer an excellent opportunity for such an exploration.
  Learning on the social dimensions of smart grids, and the international
  exchange of experiences can prevent a premature lock-in in a particular
  pathway.%

    Smart meters are progressively deployed to replace its antiquated
  predecessor to measure and monitor consumers consumption in smart grids.
  Although smart meters are equipped with encrypted communication and
  tamper-detection features, they are likely to be exposed to multiple cyber
  attacks. These meters may be easily compromised to falsify meter readings,
  which increases the chances and diversifies the types of energy theft. To
  thwart energy fraud from smart meters, utility providers are identifying
  anomalous consumption patterns reported to operation centers by leveraging on
  consumers consumption data collected from advanced metering infrastructure.
  In this paper, we put forward a new anomaly detection framework to evaluate
  consumers energy utilization behavior for identifying the localities of
  potential energy frauds and faulty meters. Metrics known as the loss factor
  and error term are introduced to estimate the amount of technical losses and
  capture the measurement noise, respectively in the distribution lines and
  transformers. The anomaly detection framework is then enhanced to detect
  consumers malfeasance and faulty meters even when there are intermittent
  cheating and faulty equipment, improving its robustness. Results from both
  simulations and test rig show that the proposed framework can successfully
  locate fraudulent consumers and discover faulty smart meters.%

    The main goal of Distribution Automation (DA) is the real-time operation,
  usually without operator intervention, of distribution systems as a
  consequence of load demand or power generation variations and failure
  conditions in the distribution systems. As real time voltage control is known
  as a legacy system that can be fully activated by DA equipments, in this
  paper an analytical study is reported to demonstrate the effects of load
  curtailments on voltages profile in distribution network. A new method for
  real time voltage control, based on emergency demand response program, is
  also proposed. The proposed method uses the real-time measured data collected
  by RTUs and determines the tap changer condition and load curtailment
  required in order to maintain the distribution voltage profile. Emergency
  conditions include outages of generators and lines, and fluctuations due to
  unpredictable load demand and renewable generation. A novel voltage
  sensitivity matrix, based on performed voltage sensitivity analysis due to
  load participation in demand response program, is also proposed. In order to
  verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme, it is
  tested on a typical automated distribution network. Simulation results show
  that the proper selection of load curtailment can improve voltage profile and
  that, in emergency conditions, demand response is an effective way to keep
  the voltage in a permissible range.%
